# mygovnyc
MyGovNYC is a Laravel/MySQL/Vue.js app that pull data and joins data from AirTables and Socrata Open Data repositories.

Its purpose is to integrate public datasets and information resources together into a single web app that displays data-driven profiles of New York City government agencies. 

Its (mildly) innovative backend allows users to connect data together even if it comes from different APIs and in different formats.

Currently the codebase is designed to meet the specific needs of the MyGov.nyc website, but we're slowly generalizing the code to make it possible for people to use it for other cities and other use caess. 

If you have any interest in helping develop or using this code for your own projet, please let us know. We'd like to help.
